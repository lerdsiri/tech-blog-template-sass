# Welcome to CSS and SASS assignment


You need to create a tech blog website. Reference layout can be found here: [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/fyN3JrM4xQQJpD7TWwvmTg/frame?node-id=0%3A1)

You do not need to strictly follow the design, take it for reference only and you can be creative.
All images can be put inside `assets/images`. There are already some images in there that you can use if you'd like or replace them with your own

Tips:

1. You can create a link between different pages of your website with the `<a>` tag. More details here: [Multi-page navigation](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Creating_multiple_pages_with_navigation_menus)

2. Use **semantic html tags** (can be found in slide) to divide your html body into different sections for accessibility

3. Focus on the html structure and styling using sass and BEM
