## Overview

A simple tech blog template made as part of the assignment at the coding bootcamp, Integrify Academy, referencing this figma layout: https://www.figma.com/file/fyN3JrM4xQQJpD7TWwvmTg/frame?node-id=0%3A1

This is solo work - github automatically added the instructor as a co-contributor who set up the original private repository under Integrify Academy github account for ease of turning in the assignment. The codes were otherwise written independently.

Note: All buttons and links lead to the same page.
